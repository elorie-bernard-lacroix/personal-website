        <p>Hi, I'm Elorie :) <br><br></p>
        <p>I'm a third-year <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/">Engineering Science</a> student
          at the University of Toronto, specializing in <a

          There are three things that I love more than anything: connecting with people, creating, and overcoming challenges. Through my
          projects and work, I strive to build tools that improve people's everyday lives and set us up for a brighter future.

      <h2>second year of university, co-op at BRP, working and living in the eastern townships of Quebec, humanoid robosoccer, reading textbooks and papers on AI  . . .</h2>
      <div id="experience1" class="description">
        <ul>
          <li>Finished my second year of Engineering Science and chose to specialize in Machine Intelligence for my last two years. I’m currently reading a machine learning textbook and research articles in the field, while building a personal project in machine learning.</li>
          <li>Joined the UofT humanoid robosoccer club as a software member. I got to participate in making the cutest little robots and mostly contributed to their computer vision. Now, I am working on their strategy code.  </li>
          <li>I took a course in Intercultural Leadership & Communication. It completely changed the way I interpret people’s actions and words. Even the way that I express myself hasn’t been the same since. One thing that I’ve been especially thinking about is how everything we do, from the way we sit down to the words we speak, can hold meaning (whether we intend it to or not). This meaning is up to the interpretation of the observer, which is shaped by their experiences, their context, their story. My favourite quote from this course: “It’s a wonder we ever understand each other at all.”</li>
          <li>Travelled around the Mediterranean with my mother, twin sister, and grandfather. Seeing their different life styles, food, values, city infrastructure, architecture, and history really made me realize the sheer amount of possibilities that exist when it comes to the way we choose to live our lives, organize ourselves, and connect with our communities.</li>
          <li>Interned at BRP, a company in Quebec (originally part of Bombardier). Interning in Quebec was something that I had been wanting to do for a while. I spent most of my childhood summers in Quebec with my family and this was the first time I was going back for a full summer since the age of 15. At BRP I got a chance to work on two very exciting projects: building a Python package to automate battery tests and fixing a set of three dynamometers (used for testing vehicles). </li>
          <li>Currently reading: Genius of Language</li>

      <div id="experience2" class="description">
        <ul>
          <li>Finished my first year of Engineering Science where I met plenty of new people and got to work on very exciting projects like building a bridge out of matboard that could support a dynamic load of 1kN! For this project I wrote a program that could simulate various bridge designs and calculate their factors of safety for my team, and our final product got us third place out of our entire year! I also took one of my favourite courses yet, data structures & algorithms, and got to dip my toes into some interesting programming concepts like semantic similarity and dynamic programming!</li>
          <li>Interned at the Ontario Public Service, as an IT systems assistant where I learned quite a bit about cybersecurity, IT lifecycles, and project management structures for big organizations. I worked with tools like Power BI for presentations and data visualization, Microsoft Visio for flow charts, and Microsoft Excel for compiling research.</li>
          <li>Qualified for worlds at the Dragon Boat Canadian Championships. I have always loved sports and staying active in university was very important to me. So, during my first year, I decided to join the engineering dragon boat team at UofT, Iron Dragons. After so much hard work and dedication my team and I went to nationals and qualified for worlds!</li>
          <li>Started taking courses on Kaggle and exploring the fascinating world of data and AI.</li>

          <li>Landed my first IT job as an IT technician at Canada’s Wonderland. I worked 20 hours a week during my second semester of high school and full time during the summer. I got to work with networks, POS systems, and peripherals. I absolutely fell in love with the process of troubleshooting and problem-solving with technology. </li>
          <li>Team captain of my high school’s FRC robotics team. I was in robotics from grade 10 to grade 12. This club taught me a lot about programming, design, and technology, but it taught me even more about the process of learning, teaching, collaborating, and leading.</li>
          <li>Flutist in my high school’s symphonic band, symphonic orchestra, and in a flute duet.</li>
          <li>Graduated from my school’s IB program and got accepted into Engineering Science at the University of Toronto with three scholarships/awards!</li>
          <li>Took certifications with IBM on Data Science Foundations and Blockchain technology.</li>
          <li>I created my first personal website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I've reiterated and it's become this :)</li>

          <h3>Final Project @ University of Toronto (CIV102 Structures and Materials). With Christine L. and Jocelyn Q.
          </h3>
          <p>This MATLAB script calculates the factor of safety for various bridge designs given a load of 400 N. It
            creates an envelope shear force and considers various types of failure including plate buckling, flexural
            compression, shear force in the glue and in the MATboard of the bridge, etc. This code was used to build an
            850 g bridge out of matboard that supported a live load of 1000 N (100 times greater than its self-weight).
            This result ranked us third place in the Engineering Science 2T6 class. For more details, please refer to
